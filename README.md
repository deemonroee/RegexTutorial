# RegexTutorial

## Description
I needed to learn how regex works to at least be able to also recognize it in the future, 
and further my knowledge of being able to code. It looks for patterns and special charcaters and transfroms them into new lines of code
It is can be very specific and can match structures of different types of strings.
